This is my personal NeoVim setup. 

The majority of the setup follows ThePrimeagen's ["0  to LSP: Neovim RC From Scratch"][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&t=1503s] tutorial.
I did not install all the plugins he installed and did not adopt the majority of his key binding remaps. 

Plugins I use not included in ThePrimeagen's setup: 
- [VimTeX][https://github.com/lervag/vimtex]
- [Colorizer][https://github.com/chrisbra/Colorizer/tree/master]
- [vim-surround][https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround]
